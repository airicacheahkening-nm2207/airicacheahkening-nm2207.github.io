            Fashion is an indispensible part of our lifes. <br>
            Fashion has indisputedly evolved throughout the years. From representing changes in eras, being an overt form <br> of self-expression,  to driving a global climate crisis, fashion has always played a part in shaping our world. <br>
            <h2>To see how influential fashion is, let's go back to the past. </h2>
            <p id="marieAntionette"> 
                When talking about the history of fashion, we definitely cannot ignore the 1700s fashion icon, <b>Marie Antionette</b>. <br>
                Known for her over-the-top fashion, she had immense influence in the fashion industry, dictating trends depending on what she wore. <br>
                One dress in particular, changed the world forever.  <br>
                <table id="marieAntoinetteTable" style="width:100%">
                <tr><td style="width:50%"><div><img src="./resources/marieantoinette.webp" alt="Marie Antoinette in a cotton gown" id="marieAntionetteportrait" height=500px></td>
              <td style="width:50%"> The French queen was painted donning a chemise. While the garment itself was scandalous at the period, it was not what caused the uproar. 
                The “chemise à la reine" was made of cotton. This was seen as a challenge towards the French's silk industry. This style of clothing quickly took over the fashion world. 
                The demand for cotton rose exponentially, driving the Indian cotton industry into overhaul. The Europeans had to find their cotton somewhere.
                Then came the Industrial Revolution and the demand for a large workforce to harvest cotton from platations, at the lowest costs possible.<br> <br>
                And with that, she ignited <b> the slavery trade</b>. <br> 
                This seemingly harmless fashion choice resulted in the cruel treatment of millions of slaves for decades to follow, and its legacy lingers with us even today.

            <h2>Is there diversity in skin tones?</h2>
                Let's take a look at their covers.<br>
                     This scatterplot presents the skin tones of models fronting the Vogue Magazine from 2000 to 2019. <br>
                     Hover over the points to see the names of the models.
                <canvas id="skinTones"></canvas>
                Using darkness values as a gauge, Vogue magazine covers show a relatively good spread of skin tones but is left skewed.<br>
               This means that the majority of models have a darkness value of less than 0.4. For Vogue to be extensively inclusive, <br>
               we hope to see more shades of skin tones, specifically in the above 0.4 area. <br>

            Fashion brands want their clothings to stand out. Models are just hangers for the clothes on runaway. <br>
            As a result, flat tummies and Barbie-long legs are prized in the industry. However, not everyone has that figure. <br>
            Brands are learning that they need to show how clothing will look like on an average human being, giving rise to the <br>
            demand for plus-size models. The demand peaked at Spring 2019, and has seen a sharp decline after.

            Paris Fashion Week which had an estimated number of 3600 models, 40 seems like a meagre amount. <br>
            Are the fashion houses really <i>trying</i> inclusive? <br>

        So, how has the industry fared as a whole? <br>
        We see some progress, but more needs to be done to bring about a genuine shift in attitutes to embrace diversity. <br>
        As an industry that defines confidence and pushes for self-empowerment, it is salient that it is clear in its messaging. <br>
        The fashion industry needs to be more inclusive in order to promote greater diversity and inclusivity.
