            Fashion is an indispensible part of our lifes. <br>
            Fashion has indisputedly evolved throughout the years. From representing changes in eras, being an overt form <br> of self-expression,  to driving a global climate crisis, fashion has always played a part in shaping our world. <br>
            <h2>To see how influential fashion is, let's go back to the past. </h2>
            <p id="marieAntionette"> 
                When talking about the history of fashion, we definitely cannot ignore the 1700s fashion icon, <b>Marie Antionette</b>. <br>
                Known for her over-the-top fashion, she had immense influence in the fashion industry, dictating trends depending on what she wore. <br>
                One dress in particular, changed the world forever.  <br>
                <table id="marieAntoinetteTable" style="width:100%">
                <tr><td style="width:50%"><div><img src="./resources/marieantoinette.webp" alt="Marie Antoinette in a cotton gown" id="marieAntionetteportrait" height=500px></td>
              <td style="width:50%"> The French queen was painted donning a chemise. While the garment itself was scandalous at the period, it was not what caused the uproar. 
                The “chemise à la reine" was made of cotton. This was seen as a challenge towards the French's silk industry. This style of clothing quickly took over the fashion world. 
                The demand for cotton rose exponentially, driving the Indian cotton industry into overhaul. The Europeans had to find their cotton somewhere.
                Then came the Industrial Revolution and the demand for a large workforce to harvest cotton from platations, at the lowest costs possible.<br> <br>
                And with that, she ignited <b> the slavery trade</b>. <br> 
                This seemingly harmless fashion choice resulted in the cruel treatment of millions of slaves for decades to follow, and its legacy lingers with us even today.

            career is short-lived unless one is able to cement her place in the industry. Age representation on the runway has had <br>
            good and bad seasons. Afterall, the modelling industry is not one easy to enter above the age of 30.

            demand for plus-size models. The demand peaked at Spring 2019, and has seen a sharp decline after.
