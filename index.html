            <h2>My Final Project</h2> 
            A data story that discusses diversity in fashion. It will look at several fashion magazines 
      and platforms and see <br> how diversity (age, race, sexuality etc.) is represented over time. 
      The data story will also touch on why it is important. <br> This is the <a href ="../finalproject/index.html">link</a> to my final project. <br>

                    <td> <b>Background </b><br>
                        Fashion, just like legislature and media, has the power to <br>
                        reflect how society views certain groups of individuals.  <br>
                        It also has the power to make a statement on important issues, such as inclusivity.</td>
                    <td> <b>Analysis</b><br>
                        The fashion industry prizes lean women that act as hangers for their clothes. While the print or advertising side seems more welcoming of diversity, the runway still has a long way to go. <br>
                        A reason for the lack of advancement could be that runway shows are largely catered for the selected few, namely celebrities or members of the upperclass who largely maintain such figures.
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Reccomendation</b><br>
                        Ultimately, the goal would be to normalise all sizes, genders, age and race as models. This could take many years. but the entire industry needs to believe in inclusivity for this to happen.

                        While there is a slow inching towards diversity, the progress is still slow and the fashion industryâ€™s commitment to inclusivity seems inconsistent and uncertain.

                        The fashion industry has been increasingly race-inclusive, but not so much in other areas. Rrepresentation is overall still low.
