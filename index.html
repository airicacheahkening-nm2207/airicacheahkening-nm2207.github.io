    <p> <h1>Final Project Idea</H1> <br>
      A data story that discusses diversity in fashion. It will look at several fashion magazines 
      and platforms and see how diversity (age, race, sexuality etc.) is represented over time. 
      The data story will also touch on why it is important.
