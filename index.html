            A data story that discusses diversity in fashion. It will look at several fashion magazines 
      and platforms and see <br> how diversity (age, race, sexuality etc.) is represented over time. 
      The data story will also touch on why it is important. <br> This is the <a href ="../finalproject/index.html">link</a> to my final project. <br>

                        Fashion, just like legislature and media, has the power to reflect how society views certain groups of individuals. It also has the power to make a statement on important issues, such as inclusivity.</td>

                        While there is a slow inching towards diversity, the progress is still slow and the fashion industryâ€™s commitment to inclusivity seems inconsistent and uncertain.
